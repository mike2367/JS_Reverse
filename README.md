Personal practice on Java Script reverse, web crawling.



# Content Including
- crypto-js
- F12 breakpoint debugging
- JS anti-aliasing
- python requests
- ### This project aims to decrypt the common JS encrytion and aliasing, therefore most of the python files are simply used for validation, not full spiders.

## Notice that some of the projects' names are written in Chinese, and phonetic transcription are used on some titles to avoid tracing.
